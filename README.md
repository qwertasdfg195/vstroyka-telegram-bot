# Telegram Kitchen Bot - Bug Fixes Documentation

This document outlines the bugs that were identified and fixed in the Telegram bot codebase.

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. Security Vulnerability - Hardcoded Credentials (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: Bot token, admin ID, and spreadsheet ID were hardcoded directly in the source code.

**Risk**: Credentials could be exposed if code is shared or stored in version control.

**Fix**: 
- Moved all sensitive configuration to environment variables
- Added validation for required environment variables
- Created `.env.example` file for documentation
- Added `python-dotenv` for better environment variable management

**Files Changed**:
- `bot.py`: Added environment variable loading and validation
- `.env.example`: Created configuration template
- `requirements.txt`: Added `python-dotenv` dependency

### 2. Logic Error - Missing Error Handling (HIGH)

**Issue**: No error handling for critical operations like Google Sheets API calls and file operations.

**Risk**: Bot crashes when external services are unavailable or files are missing.

**Fix**:
- Added try-catch blocks around Google Sheets initialization
- Added error handling for PDF catalog file operations
- Added graceful handling of admin message sending failures
- Added proper error logging and user-friendly error messages

**Files Changed**:
- `bot.py`: Added comprehensive error handling throughout the application

### 3. API Compatibility Issue - Deprecated Keyboard Method (MEDIUM)

**Issue**: Using deprecated `keyboard.add()` method from aiogram 2.x in aiogram 3.x codebase.

**Risk**: Runtime errors and unexpected behavior due to API changes.

**Fix**:
- Updated to modern keyboard builder syntax using `ReplyKeyboardMarkup` constructor
- Added proper `KeyboardButton` imports
- Updated to stable aiogram version (3.4.1) instead of beta version

**Files Changed**:
- `bot.py`: Updated keyboard creation syntax
- `requirements.txt`: Updated to stable package versions with pinned versions

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in your actual values:
     ```
     BOT_TOKEN=your_actual_bot_token
     ADMIN_ID=your_admin_user_id
     SPREADSHEET_ID=your_google_spreadsheet_id
     ```

3. **Google Sheets Setup**:
   - Place your `credentials.json` file in the project root
   - Ensure the service account has access to your Google Spreadsheet

4. **Run the Bot**:
   ```bash
   python3 bot.py
   ```
